Need Help
---------
I'm looking for help in verifying the core. If you think you can help,
please send an email to the list or to me directly.
Even though I have written a test bench and a few test, I would prefer
if someone else could verify the core as well.


STATUS
======

Second Release (5/6/2001)
-------------------------
- Made many, many changes, almost rewrote the entire thing !
  The main changes are:

     - Added Support of up to 31 channels
     - Added support for 2,4 and 8 priority levels
     - Now can have up to 31 channels
     - Added many configuration items
     - Changed reset to async

- There still might be many bugs ! Only little testing has been done !
- Please do not modify the sources (yet !) ! I'm still working on the core.
- Things that are not implemented yet, or are known not to work yet:
  - The DMA currently ignores the RTY_I (retry) input.
