Need Help
---------
I'm looking for help in verifying the core. If you think you can help,
please send an email to the list or to me directly.
Even though I have written a test bench and a few test, I would prefer
if someone else could verify the core as well.


STATUS
======

Initial Release (19/3/2001)
---------------------------
- This is the very first release of the core
- There might be still many bugs ! Only little testing has been done !
- Please do not modify the sources (yet !) ! I'm still working on the core.
- Things that are not implemented yet, or are known not to work yet:
  - The DMA currently ignores the RTY_I (retry) input.
