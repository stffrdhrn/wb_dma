Need Help
---------
I'm looking for help in verifying the core. If you think you can help,
please send an email to the list or to me directly.
Even though I have written a test bench and a few test, I would prefer
if someone else could verify the core as well.


STATUS
======

Latest Release (10/19/2001)
---------------------------
- Made the core parameterizable - no more editing of the
  wb_defines.v file, just pass the configuration to the core
  when instantiating it !

Third Release (7/27/2001)
--------------------------
- Added dma_rest_i. It allows to restart the current transfer at
  the beginning. Beginning is defined as the original values that
  where either written to the channel registers, or where fetched
  from the last external descriptor fetch.
- Made some minor changes:
   - Parametarized HW handshake signals (ack, req, nd, rest)
- There still might be many bugs ! Only little testing has been done !
- Please do not modify the sources (yet !) ! I'm still working on the core.
- Things that are not implemented yet, or are known not to work yet:
  - The DMA currently ignores the RTY_I (retry) input.


Second Release (5/6/2001)
-------------------------
- Made many, many changes, almost rewrote the entire thing !
  The main changes are:

     - Added Support of up to 31 channels
     - Added support for 2,4 and 8 priority levels
     - Now can have up to 31 channels
     - Added many configuration items
     - Changed reset to async

- There still might be many bugs ! Only little testing has been done !
- Please do not modify the sources (yet !) ! I'm still working on the core.
- Things that are not implemented yet, or are known not to work yet:
  - The DMA currently ignores the RTY_I (retry) input.


Initial Release (19/3/2001)
---------------------------
- This is the very first release of the core
- There might be still many bugs ! Only little testing has been done !
- Please do not modify the sources (yet !) ! I'm still working on the core.
- Things that are not implemented yet, or are known not to work yet:
  - The DMA currently ignores the RTY_I (retry) input.
